# shoop
PC program to send commands to the converter MCU
Based on https://github.com/libusb/hidapi and hidapitester.

You can build it the same way as hidapitester, place the binary somewhere in PATH and run it via keyboard shortcut whenever you need to read the value from the caliper.

## windows
Windows is somehow filtering the messages towards keyboard, so no luck there yet. Maybe in the future.
