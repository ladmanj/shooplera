You need PC-board from the chinese fake ST-link.
You may or may not want to replace the fake MCU with the original one (I did that when encountered problems).
The calipers voltage levels need to be shifted up a bit. That's the purpose of the added BAV99 (or similar diode).

Some day I may draw my own PCB for it in KiCAD, so check it here lately (or you can contribute to it).
